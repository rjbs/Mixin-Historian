=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package My::Object;
  use Mixin::Historian -history => {
    driver => {
      class => 'YourDriver',
      ...,
    },
  };

  # Later...
  my $object = My::Object->retrieve(1234);

  $object->add_history({
    type     => 'lava damage',
    severity => 'very badly burned',
    volcano  => 'Eyjafjallajokull',
  });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mixin::Historian is an application of Mixin::ExtraFields.  If you're not
familiar with it, you should read about it, both in L<its
documentation|Mixin::ExtraFields> and in L<this article about
Mixin::ExtraFields|http://advent.rjbs.manxome.org/2009-12-22.html>.

Generally, it provides simple mechanism for write-only history.  Importing the
C<-history> group will get you the C<add_history> method, which generally will
accept one hashref with at least a C<type> key.  This will be passed along to
the driver's C<add_history> method.

=head1 TODO

I have shoehorned an extra layer of functionality into the Historian driver
that I use in my employer's code.  When initialized, the Historian mixin is
told all legal types, something like this:

  type_map => {
    'lava damage' => {
      severity => { required => 1, store_as => 'extra_1' },
      volcano  => { required => 0, store_as => 'extra_2' },
    },
    ...
  }

This way, history entries can be validated before writing.  The C<store_as>
entries indicate how the arguments to C<add_history> are mapped to database
columns.  The entire argument is also stored in one field as JSON, and a few
other attributes are always required (like C<by_whom>) and some are added just
in time (like C<logged_at>).

This feature is not yet present in the CPAN library because I have not yet
found a suitable decomposition of concerns to make it a component.
